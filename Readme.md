Expert .NET 2.0 IL Assembler Samples
====================================

[Expert .NET 2.0 IL Assembler](http://www.apress.com/9781590596463) is a great book on CIL internals. Unfortunately,
some of the samples are slightly outdated. They were perfectly okay for .NET 2.0, but today versions have some
additional defaults so not all samples work. I've decided to improve and update these samples as I read the book.
